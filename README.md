# JumpingGame
 infinite jumping style game using the vanilla HTML canvas, where the game runs for as long as the user continues to jump over the obstacles and does not mess up by 
 colliding into one of them. If this does happen then the game will end & the users high score will show up, from this point the user will be able to restart the game
 from scratch if they want to . The game speeds up if the player manages to survive for an extended period of time.
